okay, github spies on ponytown, i know you're readin sooooo listen to me please!!!

ask before treating us like source. though, usually, some of us are fine with it if you're a sourcemate. (or, for factives, have interacted with you in source)

our outfits are not cosplays unless stated otherwise, we are a system. i, writing, am one of the hosts and the most active alongside our dudes.

majority of us don't believe in doubles, in fact, many of us accept them with open arms! however, some of us also have major issues and are generally not fond of those with the same source even if you don't act similarly, so generally be careful around those ones. they'll let you know if they're uncomfy. hey, don't complain to me, it's **their** boundaries, *not mine!*

(character) irls can interact, we won't prevent mentally ill people from interacting, we are ill ourselves, but if you start bringing us into it, we will HEAVILY reality check you.

please do NOT be rude to our gatekeeper, he will cut you off with only him being willing to cut you off. bitch can't take jokes.

our simons will not want to date you our simons will not want to date you our simons will not want to date you our simons will not want to date you you get that through your head our simons will not want to date you
